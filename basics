Mongodb   -    It is a open source , cross platform document database.It works on the concept of collection and document.Mongo uses javascript engine

  -->  Collection -  Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. Collections doesnt enforce schema.

  -->  Document   -  Document is a set of key-value pairs. Document have dynamic schema (dynamic schema means documents in same collection dont need to have same set of fields
                     or structure) also common fields in a collection document may hold different types of data.



data formats used in Mongodb  -  JSON  ,  BSON(Binary JSON)  ,  EXTENDED JSON (*BSON fomrat is used to store datas in mongodb , Extended json is used to convert BSON to human readable)

                     db.version() -  To see the version of db
                     show dbs    -  There will be 3 default dbs(admin,local,config -- DOnt use this db's for store data)
